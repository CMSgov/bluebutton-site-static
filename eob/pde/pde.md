Anatomy of BlueButton API FHIR ExplanationOfBenefit Responses
=============================================================


BlueButton  API FHIR responses contain these FHIR Resource types. 


* `Patient`
* `Coverage`
* `ExplanationOfBenefit` (EOB)


The purpose of this document is provide more detailed descriptions of the complex resource the `ExplanationOfBenefit`. `ExplanationOfBenefit` is often abbreviated as EOB.  The official documentation for the EOB is here http://hl7.org/fhir/explanationofbenefit.html.


As per the FHIR specification, if you query the API as a search operation, a `Bundle` will instead be returned containing one or more search results.  When it comes to the `Patient` resource, only one record will ever be returned.   `Coverage` usually as only a handful of entries per patient as well.  `ExplanationOfBenefit` on the other hand can have hundreds of entries.  The BB API support paging to help developers step through potentially huge responses.  by default, only 10 records are returned.  The maximum number of records that can be queries at one time is 50.  This means that developers must use paging to obtain all information when the number of EOBs is greater than 50.


Types of EOBs
-------------

The Blue Button API defines several "EOB types". These are:


* `CARRIER` - Routine office visits, etc. (Part B)
* `DME` - Durable Medical Equipment. (Part B)
* `HHA` - Home Health Services. (Part A)
* `HOSPICE` -  Hospice. (Part A)
* `INPATIENT` - Inpatient Hospital Care (Part A)
* `OUTPATIENT` - Outpatient (Part B)
* `PDE` - Pharmacy (Part D)
* `SNF` - Skilled Nursing Facility (Part A)

The current version of FHIR (STU 3) does not have a direct one-to-one mapping between the `eob-type` and the `ex-claimtype`. Please see https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/codesystem/eob-type  for more detailed information.  Based on the EOB type, the anatomy of the EOB resource will differ.  Currently, in the sample synthetic data set only `CARRIER`, `INPATIENT`, and, `PDE`.


Annotated `PDE` (Pharmacy)
-------------------------

The following search grabs a single `PDE` type ExplanationOfBenefit` as a `Bundle` for the user BBUser21919 with a Patient ID of 20140000001920, and saves it to a file called `pde.json`.


    curl --header "Authorization: Bearer some-token-you-created" "https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v1/fhir/ExplanationOfBenefit/?patient=20140000001920&startIndex=200&count=1" -o pde.json


To save bandwidth, the API response is minified.  We have "pretty printed" with indents to make it easier to annotate.  This pharmacy claim is for Simvastatin, a statin used to treat high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Its more commonly known by its brand name Zocor.  Let's step through this piece by piece:


The first section (below) lets us know the response is a Bundle and provides information about paging.  It also lets us know this particular individual has 499 EOBs.  Our query had a `count=1` so we will only have one object in the `entry` list.

            "relation": "last"
        }],

	"entry": [{...}]



The `entry` section contains most of the important details. The first part of the entry tells us that the FHIR resource type is `ExplanationOfBenefit` and its FHIR ID is `pde-6966343334`.


	"entry": [{
		"fullUrl": "https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v1/fhir/ExplanationOfBenefit/pde-6966343334",
		"resource": {
			"resourceType": "ExplanationOfBenefit",
			"id": "pde-6966343334",


The `identifier` section provides some IDs and metadata related to this PDE EOB. This tells us that the unique Part D event for a beneficiary is 6966343334. rx_srvc_rfrnc_num is the RX Service Reference Number. It tells us that the prescription reference number assigned by the pharmacy at the time the prescription was filled is "63200078748".  The claim-group is undocumented at the moment and this has been submitted to the BBAPI team for resolution.


			"identifier": [{
				"system": "https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/variables/pde_id",
				"value": "6966343334"
			}, {
				"system": "https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/identifier/claim-group",
				"value": "2030072395"
			}, {
				"system": "https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/variables/rx_srvc_rfrnc_num",
				"value": "63200078748"
			}],


The `status` of the EOB is `active` letting us know this medication is likely being taken by the beneficiary.

			"status": "active",

The `type` section provides more metadata about the EOB.  In this case, it  contains a codable concept with 2 coding systems  for `eob-type` and `ex-claimtype`.  As priorly mentioned, there is not always a one-to-one mapping between `eob-type` and `ex-claimtype`, but in the case of a pharmacy claim there is.  Both `PDE` and `pharmacy` are indicating this is a pharmacy claim. 


			"type": {
				"coding": [{
					"system": "https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/codesystem/eob-type",

				}, {

The `organization` section let's us know the organization responsible for the prescription.  The identifier is for a National Provider Identifier (NPI).  NPIs can refer to organizations or individual providers. See https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Administrative-Simplification/NationalProvIdentStand/ for more information.

				}
			},

The `facility` tells us about the facility that fulfilled the prescription.  The `phrmcy_srvc_type_cd` code of 02 tells us the pharmacy service type is a compounding pharmacy.
