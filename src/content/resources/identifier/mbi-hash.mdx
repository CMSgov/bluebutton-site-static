## Description 

The Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) is the new identification number that has replaced SSN-based health insurance claim numbers (HICNs) on all Medicare transactions, such as billing, claim submissions and appeals. The purpose of this randomly generated series of numbers and letters is to improve patient identity protection and prevent identity theft.
The MBI Hash provides security and privacy to protect the MBI during API calls.
