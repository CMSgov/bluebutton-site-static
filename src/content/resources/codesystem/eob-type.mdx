## Usage

**System URI**: `https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/codesystem/eob-type`

**Appears In:** [ExplanationOfBenefit.type](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/explanationofbenefit-definitions.html#ExplanationOfBenefit.type)

This FHIR [Coding.system](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/datatypes.html#coding) value is used for the `Coding`s that best identifies the claim/event for each `ExplanationOfBenefit` (EOB) resource. Such `ExplanationOfBenefit.type` `Coding`s will be present for all `ExplanationOfBenefit` resources returned by the API.

The `ExplanationOfBenefit.type` field will contain multiple `Coding`s, based on the type of claim/event that the EOB represents. At the moment, only the BBAPI-specific `eob-type` `Coding` is guaranteed to be present for every EOB, and so it's the one that API authors are recommended to make the most use of. This is particularly critical since the data/fields available in the EOBs vary dramatically for each `eob-type`. For example, API users should not expect that the fields present in a "`CARRIER`" EOB will also be present in an "`HHA`" EOB; **the data schema for each claim/event type is quite different!**

## Values

The following table lists all of the claim/event EOB types, along with how they're mapped for each of the possible `ExplanationOfBenefit.type` `Coding`s.
