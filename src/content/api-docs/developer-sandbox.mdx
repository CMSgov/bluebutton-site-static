To get started integrating with the Blue Button 2.0 API, you'll need to register a sandbox application. You don't need a working application at this point, but you need to define basic settings to generate client credentials for testing purposes.   

## 1\. Register an application in the developer sandbox

1. Go to the [Sandbox Dashboard](https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/home). (If you don't already have an account, create one.)
2. Click [Add an Application](https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v2/o/applications/register/).

## 2\. Enter application details

When you add or edit a sandbox application, you'll enter various required configuration details.

### Application Name

The name of your sandbox application. 

### OAuth Client Type

The Blue Button 2.0 API only supports confidential client type. 

### Authorization Grant Type 

The Blue Button 2.0 API only supports the authorization code grant type. An authorization code is a random string generated by the authorization server and returned to the application as part of the authorization response.

### Callback URLs / Redirect URIs 

This is an API endpoint on your system that receives the callback after a user successfully authorizes your application to access their Medicare data. To enter multiple URIs in the **Callback URLs / Redirect URIs** field, separate each entry with a space or new line.   

Sample format: `URIscheme://[sub-domain.]domain_name[:port]/path`

### Does my application need to collect enrollee demographic data?

This setting determines 2 things:

* What [scopes](#scopes) are applied to your application (determines which API calls your application can execute).
* The information and options displayed on the authorization screen Medicare enrollees use to allow or deny your application access to their data.

        <p>Note: When an enrollee is authorizing your application, they will have the ability to omit the patient/Patient.rs scope. Be sure that you build your application accordingly to handle a 403 error if an enrollee decides to filter their demographic information.</p>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

To learn more about scopes and permissions, visit [Authorization](#authorization).

## 3\. Save your application

Click **Save Application**.  

After you register your sandbox application, you'll get a Client ID and Client Secret.

* Client ID: an alphanumeric string used to identify your application. Use this in your code when you call the Blue Button 2.0 API.
* Client Secret: an alphanumeric string used by your application to authenticate with the Blue Button server.  

Note: Client credentials from the developer sandbox only work in the sandbox environment. To get production credentials, you need to complete the [production access requirements](#production-api-access) and be approved.  

## 4\. Test the API with Postman or cURL

Once you've created a Blue Button 2.0 sandbox application, you can start making requests. The instructions in this section will get you up and running quickly with Postman or cURL.

### Postman

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a widely used API client. To start making Blue Button 2.0 API sandbox calls in Postman, follow the steps shown below.  


1. Configure your Sandbox application to work with Postman:
    - Log into the [Blue Button 2.0 Sandbox](https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/).
    - Click **View/Edit App** for the app you want to use with Postman.
    <img style="width: 100%;" src="/src/assets/images/bb-postman-02.png" alt="View/Edit App link" />
    - Click **Edit Application**.
    <img style="width: 100%;" src="/src/assets/images/bb-postman-03.png" alt="Edit Application button" />
    - Enter the following URLs into the **Callback URLs / Redirect URIs** field, separated by a carriage return.
        - `https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback`
        - `https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/browser-callback`
        <img style="width: 100%;" src="/src/assets/images/bb-postman-04.png" alt="Callback URLs / Redirect URIs field, populated with callback URLs listed text" />
    - Click **Save Application**.
    <img style="width: 100%;" src="/src/assets/images/bb-postman-05.png" alt="Save Application button" />

2. Download the <a href="/assets/developer-resources/CMS-BlueButton-2.0-API-Sandbox.postman_collection.json" download>Blue Button 2.0 API Sandbox Postman collection</a> and import it into the Postman desktop or web application. 
    - To import the collection, either click the **Import** button in Postman and select the collection file, or drag the file into the Postman window. 

3. Select the top-level folder in the collection, **CMS BlueButton 2.0 API Sandbox**.

4. Select the **Variables** tab.

5. Copy your application's **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from your Sandbox account into both the **Initial Value** and **Current Value** cells for the corresponding Postman variables, `clientId` and `clientSecret`.

6. After copying and pasting your API credentials, log out of the Blue Button sandbox in your browser. Being logged into the sandbox can cause errors during authorization in Postman.
<img style="width: 100%;" src="/src/assets/images/bb-postman-12.png" alt="Sandbox Logout button" />

7. In Postman, select the **Authorization** tab.

8. Click **Get New Access Token**.

9. A Medicare.gov login window will open. Enter the username and password for a [synthetic sandbox user account](#authenticating-as-a-synthetic-user) (e.g., user = "BBUser00000" and password = "PW00000!"), and click **Log in**.
<img src="/src/assets/images/bb-postman-10.png" alt="Medicare login window" />

10. Click **Connect**.<img style="width: 100%;" src="/src/assets/images/bb-postman-11.png" alt="Connect button" />

11. When the **Manage Access Tokens** window appears, click **Use Token**. You may also give your token a name.

12. Make any desired Blue Button 2.0 API calls from the endpoints listed under the **Patient**, **Explanation of Benefit**, and **Coverage** folders. For example, to retrieve explanation of benefits information for the authenticated patient:
    - Select the **Explanation of Benefits** folder, then **GET Search Explanation of Benefits**.
    - Click **Send**.
    - The API will return a FHIR bundle with explanation of benefits information.

### cURL

You can also call the  Blue Button 2.0 sandbox with [cURL](https://curl.se/), a popular command-line HTTP client.

First, obtain an access token. To test using your sandbox application, you can use [Postman](#postman) to retrieve a token with your client ID and secret, as shown in the previous section. Alternately, you can get a sample authorization token from the Blue Button 2.0 Test Client as shown in the following steps:  

1. Navigate to the [Blue Button 2.0 API Test Client](https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/testclient/).

2. If you are currently logged into the Blue Button 2.0 sandbox, click **Log Out to Continue**.
<img style="width: 100%;" src="/src/assets/images/bb-postman-06.png" alt="Log Out to Continue button" />

3. Click **Get a Sample Authorization Token**.
<img style="width: 100%;" src="/src/assets/images/bb-postman-07.png" alt="Get a Sample Authorization button" />

4. Click **Authorize as a Beneficiary**.
<img style="width: 100%;" src="/src/assets/images/bb-postman-08.png" alt="Authorize as a Beneficiary button" />

5. A Medicare login screen will open. Enter the username and password for a [synthetic sandbox user account](#authenticating-as-a-synthetic-user) (e.g., user = `BBUser00000` and password = `PW00000!`), and click **Log in**.
<img src="/src/assets/images/bb-postman-10.png" alt="Medicare login window" />

6. Click **Connect**.<img style="width: 100%;" src="/src/assets/images/bb-postman-11.png" alt="Connect button" />

7. A new page will open. Copy the access token from the JSON shown under **Step 1: Sample Authorization** for use in your cURL command.
<img style="width: 100%;" src="/src/assets/images/bb-postman-09.png" alt="JSON object with access token highlighted" />

Once you have an access token, you can start making API calls with cURL. For example, the following command will retrieve explanation of benefit information for the authenticated patient (replace `<YOUR ACCESS TOKEN>` with your actual access token):  


`curl --location "https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v2/fhir/ExplanationOfBenefit/" --header "Accept: application/json" --header "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR ACCESS TOKEN>"
`
