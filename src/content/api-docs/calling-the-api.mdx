To find enrollees with varying volumes and types of data, use this [CSV of synthetic data](/synthetic_users_by_claim_count_full.csv). Using the synthetic data, you can break down claims by type (carrier, inpatient, etc.) for each enrollee/user combination.  Synthetic data works in both the Sandbox and Production environments.
