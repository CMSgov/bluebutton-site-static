## FHIR resources

Over 600 fields from the CCW are mapped to FHIR. These fields are surfaced across the Patient, Coverage and Explanation of Benefits FHIR resources from the [FHIR standard](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/):

- [Explanation of Benefit](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/explanationofbenefit.html) (EOB): Primary source of claims data. The EOB resource contains the lines within an episode of care, including where and when the service was performed, the diagnosis codes, the provider who performed the service, and the cost of care.
- [Patient](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/patient.html): Provides information about patients including demographic information and updates to their patient identifiers.
- [Coverage](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/coverage.html): Provides information about the enrollees' insurance coverage, including information about dual coverage.

### Explanation of Benefit

The Explanation of Benefit resource provides data for the following claim types:  

- Inpatient (INPATIENT)
- Outpatient (OUTPATIENT)
- Skilled Nursing Facility Claims (SNF)
- Hospice (HOSPICE)
- Home Health Agency Claims (HHA)
- Carrier (Professional)
- Durable Medical Equipment (DME)
- Prescription Drug Events - Part D (PDE)  

Request:

```http
GET /v2/fhir/ExplanationOfBenefit/?patient=[fhir_id]
```

This request returns claims as [Explanation of Benefit Resources](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/explanationofbenefit.html) inside a [FHIR Bundle](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/bundle.html).

## UserInfo

The UserInfo endpoint is an OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource that returns information about an authenticated user.   

Note that users can choose to allow or deny access to the UserInfo endpoint in the Medicare.gov authorization flow. For more information, go to [Scopes](/api-docs/authorization#scopes). 

```http
GET /connect/userinfo
```

The above URL returns basic information about the user, given an authorization token. An HTTP GET is called and the response is returned as JSON.  

Request:

```bash title=Terminal
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN" "https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v2/connect/userinfo"
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "sub": "-123456789",
  "prefered_username": "fflinstone",
  "given_name": "Fred",
  "family_name": "Flinstone",
  "name": "FredFlinstone",
  "email": "pebbles-daddy@example.com",
  "created": "2017-11-28",
  "patient": "-123456789"
}
```

## Terminology and coding systems

The Blue Button API supplies codified data using several different terminology and coding systems, defined by various standards bodies, along with locally defined CMS coding systems: 

- [ICD-10](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/ICD10)
- [HCPCS](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/MedHCPCSGenInfo)
- [CPT Codes](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Fraud-and-Abuse/PhysicianSelfReferral)
- [National Drug Code Directory](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/national-drug-code-directory)
- [CMS Claim Type](/resources/codesystem/eob-type/)  

Additional information about coding systems can be found on the [terminology page](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/artifacts.html#5) of the [CARIN Implementation Guide](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/index.html) and in the [Blue Button Code System Listing (CSV 77KB)](/assets/csv/bluebutton_system_listing.csv).  

The Blue Button API also provides data in [FHIR Extensions](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/extensibility.html). FHIR extensions are custom data elements that are not found in the FHIR standard:

- [Blue Button extensions in v2 (CSV 96KB)](/assets/csv/BB_V2_extension_listing.csv)

## Refresh rate and rate limiting

Data from the CCW is pulled into the Blue Button API database on a weekly basis. The weekly data pull may be delayed for maintenance or because of delayed delivery of claims to the CCW.  

Our rate limit is high enough to accommodate the needs of anyone integrating with the Blue Button API. The Blue Button API is one of 4 CMS APIs that share the same data from the CCW. Blue Button is for single data calls for an individual Medicare enrollee and the other 3 APIs are designed for bulk data calls. Because the rate limit is set based on the needs the bulk data APIs, the rate limit is higher than required for an application making single API calls using Blue Button.
