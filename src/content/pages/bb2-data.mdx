description: "CMS Blue Button uses the HL7 FHIR standard for pulling Medicare Part A, B, and D enrollee data and the OAuth 2.0 standard for enrollee authorization."

The Blue Button database pulls data from the [CMS Chronic Conditions Warehouse (CCW)](https://www2.ccwdata.org/web/guest/home/), which contains Medicare Part A, B and D claims data going back to 2014. 

<table class="usa-table usa-table--borderless usa-table--stacked margin-bottom-4">

Note: Blue Button API does not provide Medicare Part C claims (Medicare Advantage). However, if a Medicare Advantage enrollee has a Part D plan, the API includes those claims.

## Synthetic data

Because access to real claims data is restricted in order to protect the privacy of Medicare enrollees, CMS created synthetic user accounts representing enrollment information and healthcare claims for 10,000 Medicare enrollees. Since synthetic data are realistic-but-not-real data, the typical privacy and security restrictions do not apply.  

Although the synthetic user accounts are not tied to any real patient data, they mimic real claims data. For example, if a patient is prescribed the diabetes medication Metformin, the associated cost and date of this prescription will be realistic. However, the synthetic data set does not represent a longitudinal patient view or true clinical scenario. This allows you to test your integration with Blue Button API, but could result in a patient with records for contradictory procedures. 

### Working with synthetic user accounts

The Blue Button API offers 10,000 synthetic user accounts for you to test with in both the sandbox and production environments:

<table class="usa-table usa-table--borderless usa-table--stacked margin-bottom-4">
  <caption class="usa-sr-only">Synthetic user account ranges and details</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">User account ranges</th>
      <th scope="col">Date updated</th>
      <th scope="col">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`BBUser00000` to `BBUser09999`</td>
      <td>Rolling claims updated weekly.<br/><br/>Loaded July 2023</td>
      <td>These accounts receive new claims data on a rolling basis. These user accounts represent a range of Medicare demographics and ages, including people under 65 who qualify for Medicare for reasons other than age.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`BBUser10000`</td>
      <td>Last Updated 2022</td>
      <td>`BBUser10000` is a special synthetic user that provides nearly every field the API supports, including a variety of claim types. This makes it an excellent testing account for populating test scenarios.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

To differentiate between synthetic data and real patient production data, synthetic records have negative Patient ID and Explanation of Benefit values (example synthetic Patient ID: -10000010254618). Real Patient IDs will always have positive values.  

### Authenticating as a synthetic user

Each of our 10,000 synthetic user accounts have Medicare.gov login credentials. To log in as a synthetic user, use the following username/password combination pattern when authorizing a test user with Blue Button:

- Username: BBUserXXXXX (Example: BBUser00005)
- Password: PWXXXXX! (Example: PW00005!)  

### Claim dates in rolling claims updates

When new data is added for a synthetic user account in the weekly update, the new data includes claims dated 1-2 weeks prior. This delay simulates real claim processing time in production data. Get updated claims using the [\_lastUpdated query parameter](/api-documentation/optimizing-your-app/#query-by-lastupdated-field).
