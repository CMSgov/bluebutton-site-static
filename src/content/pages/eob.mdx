## Overview

The [ExplanationOfBenefit FHIR Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/explanationofbenefit.html) is how the Blue Button 2.0 API represents the bulk of the beneficiary's data.  Each one can be thousands of lines long.

```bash title="Terminal"
curl "https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v1/fhir/ExplanationOfBenefit/?patient=20140000008325" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN"
```

## Bundle

In FHIR, a [Bundle](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/bundle-definitions.html) is a collection of resources.  You will see type, total and more specified for the Bundle.

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Bundle",
  "id": "13ea5887-2d4b-437e-80e5-3c18b6e6e185",
  "meta": {
    "lastUpdated": "2018-02-22T23:35:27.878-05:00"
  }
}
```

Within each entry, you will find additional `resourceTypes` such as `Observation` or `ReferralRequest` that classifies the entry. Each entry will have information like `Code` and `valueQuantity`. Resources have many ResourceTypes such as `ReferralRequest`, `Observation`, etc.

## Paging

We are using the [link element of the Bundle resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/bundle-definitions.html) to handle paging.

```json
{
  "link": [
    {
      "relation": "self",
      "url": "https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v1/fhir/ExplanationOfBenefit/?patient=20140000008325&startIndex=0&count=10"
    },
    {
      "relation": "next",
      "url": "https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v1/fhir/ExplanationOfBenefit/?patient=20140000008325&startIndex=10&count=10"
    },
    {
      "relation": "last",
      "url": "https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v1/fhir/ExplanationOfBenefit/?patient=20140000008325&startIndex=130&count=10"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Entry

Each Entry in the Bundle contains an Explanation of Benefit ("claim") and can be thousands of lines long.

```json
{
  "entry": [
    {
      "fullUrl": "https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v1/fhir/ExplanationOfBenefit/carrier-22011027731",
      "resource": {
        "resourceType": "ExplanationOfBenefit",
        "id": "carrier-22011027731",
        "contained": [
          {
            "resourceType": "ReferralRequest",
            "id": "1",
            "status": "completed",
            "subject": {
              "reference": "Patient/20140000008325"
            },
            "requester": {
              "agent": {
                "identifier": {
                  "system": "http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-npi",
                  "value": "999999999999"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
  // ... and thousands of lines of additional data...
}
```

You will find these FHIR resources in the Entry:

- resourceType
- id
- contained
- extension
- identifier
- status
- type
- patient
- billableperiod
- referral
- disposition
- careTeam
- diagnosis
- insurance
- item
- payment
- benefitBalance

## Item

The Item resource with the Entry resource contains the bulk of the Explanation of Benefit information including:

- extension
- sequence
- careTeamLinkId
- diagnosisLinkId
- category
- service
- modifier
- servicedPeriod
- locationCodeableConcept
- quantity
- adjudication

You will see the Extension FHIR resource with CMS specific coding systems as well as common industry coding systems.

```json
{
  "item": [
    {
      "extension": [
        {
          "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v3-ActInvoiceGroupCode",
          "valueCoding": {
            "system": "http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v3-ActInvoiceGroupCode",
            "code": "CSPINV"
          }
        },
        {
          "url": "https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/variables/carr_line_mtus_cd",
          "valueCoding": {
            "system": "https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/variables/carr_line_mtus_cd",
            "code": "3",
            "display": "Services"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Most of the output follows a similar pattern.  Here you see the Category FHIR resource with a system, code and display value.

```json
{
  "category": {
    "coding": [
      {
        "system": "https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/variables/line_cms_type_srvc_cd",
        "code": "1",
        "display": "Medical care"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The Adjudication resource contains a depth of financial information about the claim processing.  

```json
{
  "adjudication": [
    {
      "category": {
        "coding": [
          {
            "system": "CMS Adjudications",
            "code": "https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/variables/carr_line_rdcd_pmt_phys_astn_c",
            "display": "Carrier Line Reduced Payment Physician Assistant Code"
          }
        ]
      },
      "reason": {
        "coding": [
          {
            "system": "https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/variables/carr_line_rdcd_pmt_phys_astn_c",
            "code": "0",
            "display": "N/A"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "extension": [
        {
          "url": "https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/variables/line_pmt_80_100_cd",
          "valueCoding": {
            "system": "https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/variables/line_pmt_80_100_cd",
            "code": "0",
            "display": "80%"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
