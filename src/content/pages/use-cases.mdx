BB2.0 API data is valuable for any organization interested in innovating with claims data from over 64 million Medicare enrollees. The API serves a variety of use cases and we encourage you to explore ways to use BB2.0 API data to support Medicare enrollees in making healthcare decisions. 

Examples of current use cases include:

<IconList heading="Personal health data aggregators">
    Digital health applications can use BB2.0 to give Medicare enrollees a more comprehensive view of their health data. Access to personal health data can make Medicare enrollees more aware of their health conditions, helping them communicate more effectively with their providers. Research shows that thirty percent of  Medicare enrollees have 2 or 3 chronic conditions and see 5 or more physicians annually.<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a> Helping Medicare enrollees gather their health information in one place makes it easier for them to coordinate care across providers and may minimize redundant procedures.

<IconList heading="Insurance plan finders">
    BB2.0 API data can help filter insurance plan options based on a Medicare enrollee's specific health history and needs. Medicare enrollees can use insurance plan finder tools directly or Medicare brokers can use these tools to advise patients on the best plan options.

    For example, with BB2.0 you can: 

    * Use claims and utilization data to make personalized recommendations for new plan options.
    * Estimate prescription costs to optimize Medicare plan guidance.
    * Check if a Medicare enrollee's current providers are in-network for various plan options.

<IconList heading="Clinical research studies">
    Organizations conducting healthcare research and clinical trials often require participants to fill out long forms or regularly submit data over the course of the study. Medicare enrollees can authorize a research study to automatically pull their claims data with BB2.0, reducing the need for manual data entry.

<IconList heading="Health record sharing">
    BB2.0 API can make it easy for Medicare enrollees to share their health data with doctors, pharmacies, caregivers, and others. 

    You can use BB2.0 to:

    * Integrate BB2.0 data with Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems to import current health information.
    * Allow patients to share health information like current medications, lab results, and medical imaging with providers.
    * Give caregivers an accurate picture of a Medicare enrollee's health data to facilitate care coordination and communication with providers.
