Blue Button 2.0 (BCDA) uses [Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/overview.html) to share claims data. You can use a variety of tools or client software programs to access the sandbox and production environments.

Blue Button 2.0 (BB2.0) API enables software developers to build trusted applications, services, and research programs that benefit Medicare enrollees. As a [standards-based API](#technical-specifications-and-standards), BB2.0 provides claims data for more than 64 million people with Medicare.

BB2.0 API includes more than 20 billion Medicare Part A, B and D claims going back to 2014.

Note: Blue Button 2.0 API does not provide Medicare Part C claims (Medicare Advantage). However, if a Medicare Advantage enrollee has a Part D plan, the API includes those claims.

## Access to Medicare enrollee data

### Scope of access

Applications receive permission to access Medicare enrollee data on a per-user basis. Access to claims data for each individual enrollee begins after they grant access to an application via the BB2.0 API's authorization flow. 

Medicare enrollees may always opt to omit personal data such as name, date of birth, race, and sex when granting access to claims data. An enrollee's choice during the BB2.0 authorization flow determines the [scope](#scopes) of access an application will have to their data. 

### Duration of access

The length of time that an application can continue to pull new claims data from Medicare depends on the application's use case and category. The BB2.0 API team determines your application's access duration category during the [production access process](/guide/). 

There are 3 categories for data access duration:

          <li>Authorization will be granted for 10 hours, without the ability to refresh the token.</li>
          <li>If an enrollee uses the app more than once outside the 10-hour window, they must reauthorize for each data pull.</li>
        </ul>

      <th scope="row">13 months</th>

          <li>Authorization will be granted for 13 months.</li>
          <li>For continued access after 13 months, an app must prompt the user to reauthorize.</li>

          <li>Research apps will be reviewed every 2 years to ensure that they are still active.</li>
          <li>If a research app is not active at a 2-year check-in, we will contact the app team for confirmation that they still need BB2.0 API access.</li>
          <li>If you have a research app, please keep us updated on changes to your contact information and watch for emails from BlueButtonAPI@cms.hhs.gov.</li>

## Technical Specifications and Standards 

The Blue Button 2.0 API is a RESTful API, based on the HL7 FHIR standard and the CARIN Consumer Directed Payer Data Exchange Implementation Guide. It supplies data in JSON format, and uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authorization.

* [HL7 FHIR Standard](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/index.html)
* [CARIN Consumer Directed Payer Data Exchange Implementation Guide](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/index.html)
* [OAuth 2.0 protocol](https://oauth.net/)
* [RESTful API Overview](https://restfulapi.net/)

## Versions

We currently support 2 BB2.0 API versions:

### Version 2 

BB2.0 Version 2 (V2) is based on [FHIR release (R4)](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/) and the [CARIN CDPDE Implementation Guide (Carin for Blue Button)](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/STU1.1/) and was released in July 2021\. To learn about migrating to BB2.0 V2, go to [Migrating to V2 FAQ](https://github.com/CMSgov/beneficiary-fhir-data/wiki/Migrating-to-V2-FAQ)

### Version 1 

Version 1 (V1) is the original Blue Button API, based on [FHIR release 3 (STU3)](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/). Development on V1 is limited to bug fixes and basic maintenance. If you're developing a new app, use V2\. For information about BB2.0 V1, see the [V1 Documentation](/v1/). 

## Environments

We currently maintain production and sandbox environments for developing with the BB2.0 API. For technical information about our environments, see [Base FHIR URLs](#base-fhir-urls). 

### Sandbox

Develop your application using our sandbox environment. It provides access to synthetic Medicare enrollee data and includes all the same endpoints, resource types, and parameters as production. You can complete all of the same operations in the sandbox as in the production environment.

It's helpful to know that:

* Sandbox credentials will not work in production. 
* While we strive to provide a synthetic data set relevant to most use cases, our synthetic data set is not as comprehensive as production data.

To get started in the developer sandbox, [create an account](https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v2/accounts/mfa/login).

### Production

Once your development is nearing completion, get access to live data in our production environment by following the instructions in our [production access user guide](/guide/). After you complete the requirements in the production access guide and your app is approved, we'll give you credentials for the production environment.
