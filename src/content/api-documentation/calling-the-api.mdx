This section provides information on basic and common queries against the Blue Button API.  For a complete listing of Blue Button API calls, see our [Swagger documentation](https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/docs/openapi).

## Sandbox vs. Production Environments

### Sandbox

- Available to everyone via test credentials
- Contains test claims data
- Base FHIR URL: `https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v2/fhir/`

### Production

- Must [complete the steps](/production-access) for production credentials
- Contains real Medicare enrollee data
- Base FHIR URL: `https://api.bluebutton.cms.gov/v2/fhir/`

To find enrollees with varying volumes and types of data, use this [CSV of synthetic data](/synthetic_users_by_claim_count_full.csv). Using the synthetic data, you can break down claims by type (carrier, inpatient, etc.) for each enrollee/user combination.  Synthetic data works in both the Sandbox and Production environments.

## Querying Resources
