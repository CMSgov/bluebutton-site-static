The Blue Button API includes over 1300 data elements with a wide variety of data exchange use cases. Here are some basics to get you started with common data elements. 

For complete implementation guidance, see the [FHIR specification](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/index.html) and the [CARIN implementation guide](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/index.html). Our [Resources page](/data/resources) also includes links to tutorials and helpful information on FHIR.

## Understanding the payload

Blue Button API [search operations](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#search) (like `/Patient`, `/ExplanationOfBenefit`, and `/ExplanationOfBenefit?patient=123`) return data in [FHIR Bundles](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html). A FHIR bundle is a container resource that includes a collection of FHIR resources. You can grab each resource by looping through the `Bundle.entry` list attribute.  

[Read calls](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#read) such as `/Patient/123` return a single resource.

FHIR `Bundle` example:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Bundle",
  "id": "123",
  // ...
  "type": "searchset",
  "total": 99,
  "entry": [
    {
      "resource": {
        "resourceType": "ExplanationOfBenefit",
        "id": "carrier--123"
        // ...
      }
    },
    {
      "resource": {
        "resourceType": "ExplanationOfBenefit",
        "id": "carrier--456"
        // ...
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Navigating through a bundle

FHIR search results are paginated because they typically contain many records. The default is 10 records in each call. You can override the default of 10 with a _count parameter in the request. The maximum records allowed is 50.

To navigate forward and backward through the bundle, use the URLs provided in `Bundle.link`, as described in the table below. For instance, to get the next `X` records, use the URL supplied in `Bundle.link` where `relation = next`.  

 <table class="usa-table usa-table--borderless usa-table--stacked margin-bottom-4">
     <caption class="usa-sr-only">Relations for navigating through a bundle</caption>
     <thead>
         <tr>
             <th scope="col">Relation</th>
             <th scope="col">Description</th>
         </tr>
     </thead>
     <tbody>
         <tr>
             <td>first</td>
             <td>Retrieve the first X records in the resultset</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
             <td>next</td>
             <td>Retrieve the next X records in the resultset</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
             <td>previous</td>
             <td>Retrieve the previous X records in the resultset</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
             <td>last</td>
             <td>Retrieve the last X records in the resultset</td>
         </tr>
     </tbody>
 </table>

In the example below, the `Bundle.total` attribute shows that there are 89 records in the results. However, only the first 10 records are delivered in the `Bundle.entry` array. 

For more information on Bundles and FHIR search results, see [FHIR v4.3.0 Bundle](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html) and [FHIR v4.3.0 Managing Returned Resources](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#return). 

Bundle navigation example:


```json
{
  "resourceType": "Bundle",
  "id": "5e5844c4-d3e2-44ca-8c87-77efccc5d60d",
  // ...
  "total": 89,
  "link": [
    {
      "relation": "first",
      "url": "{host}/v2/fhir/ExplanationOfBenefit?startIndex=0&_count=10&patient=..."
    },
    {
      "relation": "next",
      "url": "{host}/v2/fhir/ExplanationOfBenefit?startIndex=10&_count=10&patient=..."
    },
    {
      "relation": "last",
      "url": "{host}/v2/fhir/ExplanationOfBenefit?&startIndex=..."
    },
    {
      "relation": "self",
      "url": "{host}/v2/fhir/ExplanationOfBenefit?&startIndex=..."
    }
  ],
}
```

## Working with identifiers

In FHIR, the difference between the `Resource.id` (resource ID) and `identifier` attributes within a resource can be confusing. 

- **Resource ID:** In the Blue Button API, the resource ID is an internal identifier from the source database, the Chronic Conditions Warehouse (CCW).  The resource ID is a system-level resource, held outside the resource.  The Resource ID is guaranteed to be unique for a particular resource and will always be limited to one value.

- **Identifier:** The identifier attribute typically provides business identifiers (or externally recognized identifiers).  In the Blue Button API, the `Patient.identifier` attribute provides the [Medicare Beneficiary ID (MBI)](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/new-medicare-card). The MBI is the number on an enrollee's Medicare card.

In FHIR, the identifier attribute is a list element that could supply multiple identifiers. Use [discriminators](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html#discriminator) to distinguish between the entries to pull your desired identifier.  

For example, you can use discriminators to pull the current MBI from a Patient resource. (Enrollees are sometimes given new or replacement MBIs in situations such as identity theft.) In the `Patient` resource snippet below, there are two identifiers in the list. Use the following discriminators to pull the current MBI: 
- `identifier.system` = `http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-mbi` (ensures that the entry is an MBI)
- `identifier.type.coding[n].extension.valueCoding.code` = "current"

Patient identifier example:

```json
{
  "identifier": [
    {
      "system": "http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-mbi",
      "type": {
        "coding": [
          {
            "code": "MC",
            "extension": [
              {
                "url": "https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/codesystem/identifier-currency",
                "valueCoding": {
                  "code": "current"
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      "value": "<CURRENT MBI HERE>"
    },
    {
      "system": "http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-mbi",
      "type": {
        "coding": [
          {
            "code": "MC",
            "extension": [
              {
                "url": "https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/codesystem/identifier-currency",
                "valueCoding": {
                  "code": "historic"
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      "value": "<HISTORIC MBI HERE>"
    }
  ]
}
```

Example [FHIRPath expression](https://hl7.org/fhir/fhirpath.html)  for pulling the current MBI:

```ruby
Patient.identifier.where(type.coding.extension('https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/codesystem/identifier-currency').valueCoding.code ='current').where(system = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/us-mbi').value
```

## Working with references

The Blue Button API uses both [literal](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/references.html#literal) and [logical](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/references.html#logical) FHIR references to refer to other resources/data external to the resource.

### Literal references

For literal references, relative URLs are provided.  In the sample EOB resource below, the `Eob.patient` attribute contains a relative URL reference, `/Patient/123`. Append this path to the base FHIR URL to perform a Patient read operation. 

Literal reference example:


```json
{
  "resource": {
    "resourceType": "ExplanationOfBenefit",
    "id": "carrier--10045426206",
    // ...
    "patient": {
      "reference": "Patient/123"
    }
  }
}
```

### Contained resources

The Blue Button API also uses fragments and [contained resources](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/references.html#contained).  A resource that does not have independent existence is embedded inside another resource as a contained resource.  For example, the Organization resource does not have its own endpoint. Instead, it is supplied as a contained resource with EOB. In the example EOB resource below, the organization resource is within the `Eob.contained` attribute, and the `Eob.provider` attribute has a `#` reference to `contained.id` (`#provider-org`).   

Contained resource example:

```json
{ 
	"contained": [
		{
			"active": true,
			"id": "provider-org",
			"identifier": [
				{
					"type": {
						"coding": [
							{
								"code": "PRN",
								"system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203"
							}
						]
					}
				}
			]
		}
	],
	// ...
	"provider": {
		"reference": "#provider-org"
	}
},
```

### Logical references

[Logical references](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/references.html#logical) typically supply a business identifier instead of a URL to an endpoint or contained resource.  

In the example below, the `Eob.careTeam.provider` attribute contains a reference to the the [National Provider Identifier (NPI)](https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/) for the practitioner.  (Note: The Blue Button API  does not support a `/Practitioner` endpoint.)

Logical reference example:

```json
{
  "careTeam": [
    {
      "provider": {
        "identifier": {
          "type": {
            "coding": [
              {
                "code": "npi",
                "display": "National Provider Identifier",
                "system": "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/CodeSystem/C4BBIdentifierType"
              }
            ]
          },
          "value": "123"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Extensions and SupportingInfo

The Blue Button API supplies many data points using [FHIR extensions](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/extensibility.html).  Extensions are information that is not part of the basic definition of the FHIR resource. They're often very specific to a use case or situation.  For example, the Blue Button API uses extensions to supply Medicare-specific data points that are not part of the standard FHIR specification. 

All Blue Button API resources include extensions.  Extensions are like a key-value list, where the extension URL is the key. In an extension, the value attribute is defined as [Choice of Types](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/formats.html#choice), where the data type depends on the definition of the extension.    

In the example below, there are two extensions: 
- [NCH Near Line Record Identification Code](/resources/variables/nch_near_line_rec_ident_cd/) provides the value as a `valueCoding` type
- [Carrier or MAC Number](/resources/variables/carr_num/)   is a `valueIdentifier`

*Note: In the Blue Button API, the extension URL points at an underlying valueset rather than the standard FHIR practice of the URL pointing to the [StructureDefinition](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/structuredefinition.html) of the extension.  This is due to historical reasons and will be revisited in future versions of Blue Button.*

Extension example:

```json
{
  "extension": [
    {
      "url": "https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/variables/nch_near_line_rec_ident_cd",
      "valueCoding": {
        "code": "O",
        "display": "Part B physician/supplier claim record (processed by local carriers; can include DMEPOS services)",
        "system": "https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/variables/nch_near_line_rec_ident_cd"
      }
    },
    {
      "url": "https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/variables/carr_num",
      "valueIdentifier": {
        "system": "https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/variables/carr_num",
        "value": "15202"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### SupportingInfo attribute

The `supportingInfo` attribute is a standard element in the FHIR EOB resource. Similar to extensions, `suportingInfo` is like a key-value list. `supportingInfo.category` serves as the key and `supportingInfo.code` is the value.   Other attributes in `supportingInfo` include `timing[x]`, `value[x]`, and `reason`.  

*Note: The [CARIN Implementation Guide](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/index.html) has chosen to use `supportingInfo` over extensions.  The CARIN IG does not define any extensions.  For historical and backwards compatibility reasons, the Blue Button API provides data in both extensions and `supportingInfo`.*

## Determining claim type

The Blue Button API supplies claims data in the [ExplanationOfBenefit resource](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/explanationofbenefit.html) for all claim types (Example: Inpatient, Outpatient, Carrier, DME, etc.)

To determine the type of a given claim, inspect the `Eob.type` attribute.  `Eob.type` is a `CodeableConcept`, which provides data as a list of codings. There are multiple entries in the list. 

Each entry is a code from a given codesystem or valueset with information about the type of claim.  For example, the `NCH_CLM_TYPE_CD` codesystem uses the code `71` for a carrier claim. The Blue Button API `eob-type` valueset uses a code of `CARRIER` for a carrier claim.  

Claim type example:

```json
{
  "type": {
    "coding": [
      {
        "code": "71",
        "display": "Local carrier non-durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) claim",
        "system": "https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/variables/nch_clm_type_cd"
      },
      {
        "code": "CARRIER",
        "system": "https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/codesystem/eob-type"
      }
      // ...
    ]
  }
}
```

For more information about determining claim types, see the following coding system reference links:
- [EOB type](/resources/codesystem/eob-type/)
- [NCH Claim Type Code variable](/resources/variables/nch_clm_type_cd/)
- [FHIR Claim Type value set](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/valueset-claim-type.html)

## Linking items

The `item` data element in the EOB resource supplies a list of entries describing products/services provided.  You can link each entry in the list to other parts of the EOB using the `item.*sequence elements`.  

For example, `Eob.item.diagnosisSequence` links to `Eob.diagnosis.sequence`, which tells you that this product/service is linked to the corresponding diagnosis.  In the partial EOB example below, the `item` is linked to diagnosis `1` and careTeam member `3`.

Linking item example:

```json
{
  "item": [
    {
      "adjudication": [
        // ...
      ],
      "diagnosisSequence": [
        1
      ],
      "careTeamSequence": [
        3
      ]
      // ...
    }
  ],
  "diagnosis": [
    {
      "sequence": 1,
      "diagnosisCodeableConcept": {
        "coding": [
          {
            "code": "Z0000",
            "display": "ENCNTR FOR GENERAL ADULT MEDICAL EXAM W/O ABNORMAL FINDINGS"
          }
        ]
        // ...
      }
    }
  ],
  "careTeam": [
    {
      "sequence": 1
      // ...
    },
    {
      "sequence": 2
      // ...
    },
    {
      "sequence": 3,
      "provider": {
        "identifier": {}
        // ...
      },
      "role": {
        "coding": [
          {
            "code": "performing",
            "display": "Performing provider"
            // ...
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
