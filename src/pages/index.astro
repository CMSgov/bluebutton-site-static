        <h3>What does Blue Button allow you to do?</h3>
        <p>
          Whether you are a health plan market place, a non-profit research organization, or a healthcare startup -
          integration with Blue Button provides value to organizations that deliver services to people with Medicare.
        </p>
        <p>
          People with Medicare can allow access to their data, which can improve data accuracy and efficiency over
          manual data entry. Faster, more accurate data can lead to better service recommendations and health outcomes
          for beneficiaries.

        <h2>Value for people with Medicare</h2>
        <h3>What does Blue Button allow you to do?</h3>
        <p>
          Blue Button allows you to share your data with third-party applications, doctors, research programs, and more!
          It also gives beneficiaries and their caregivers more options and control over their claims data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team is working on new features that allow people with Medicare to have more control over the types of
          data third-party applications can see and use.
