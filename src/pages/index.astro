          Medicare.
        </p>
        <p>
          People with Medicare can allow access to their data, which can improve data accuracy and efficiency over
          manual data entry. Faster, more accurate data can lead to better service recommendations and health outcomes

        <p>
          Blue Button 2.0 allows you to share your data with third-party applications, doctors, research programs, and
