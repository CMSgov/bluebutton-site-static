Hi, my name is Mark Scrimshire. I am the Blue Button Innovator and Developer Evangelist at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  
I have been involved with the Blue Button 2.0 API project since the very beginning and I am excited to see it released to the 
Developer community so they can start building applications that will benefit our Medicare Beneficiaries.

You can find me on Twitter, LinkedIn and other social media hangouts talking about [#bluebutton](https://twitter.com/#bluebutton) as [@ekivemark](https://twitter.com/ekivemark). 
I will be posting articles here that I hope will be useful to our growing community of Blue Button 2.0 API developer users.

While the Blue Button API team have been busy building the API we have also created a few sample applications that may be helpful 
to you as you look to work with our HL7 FHIR-based API. 
We will be using this blog to post links to sample applications, code recipes, "how-to" guides and other useful artifacts. 
If there is something in particular you would like to see addressed please head over to our 
[CMS Blue Button Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/Developer-group-for-cms-blue-button-api) and let us know. 
We love your feedback!
