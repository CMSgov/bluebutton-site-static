[The Interoperability and Patient Access final rule](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Interoperability/index) requires CMS-regulated payers to implement and maintain a secure, standards-based Patient Access API using Health Level 7® (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources® (FHIR) 4.0.1 that allows patients to easily access their claims and encounter information through third-party applications of their choice.

In concert with this requirement, CMS will be releasing a Version 2 (V2) of the Blue Button 2.0 API in 2021 that will be consistent with HL7’s FHIR R4. V2 will also conform with the [CARIN Alliance Blue Button® Framework and Common Payer Consumer Data Set (CPCDS) IG](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/carin-bb/history.html). More information about the timeline of the roll out of the Blue Button 2.0 API V2 and what these changes might mean for your application can be found in our [FAQ](https://github.com/CMSgov/beneficiary-fhir-data/wiki/Migrating-to-V2-FAQ).

Watch the [Blue Button 2.0 API Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/developer-group-for-cms-blue-button-api) for further announcements about Version 2 of the Blue Button 2.0 API and updates to our [FAQ](https://github.com/CMSgov/beneficiary-fhir-data/wiki/Migrating-to-V2-FAQ).

After reviewing the FAQ, if you have any additional questions about V2 of the Blue Button 2.0 API, post to the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/developer-group-for-cms-blue-button-api) or send us an email at [BFD@cms.hhs.gov](BFD@cms.hhs.gov).
