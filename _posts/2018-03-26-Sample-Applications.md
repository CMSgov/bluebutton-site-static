As a developer I often find it easier to take a sample application and modify 
it to meet my needs rather than build an application from scratch. The Blue Button 
API team have tried to help others like me by creating some sample applications that you can
build from.

We will continue to build up this library of sample client applications and 
welcome contributions from other developers. Here are links to the current sample
client applications:

- Node.js: [bluebutton-sample-client-nodejs](https://github.com/CMSgov/bluebutton-sample-client-nodejs)
- Python/Django: [bluebutton-sample-client-django](https://github.com/CMSgov/bluebutton-sample-client-django)

In future blog posts I will cover how to install, configure and run each of these 
sample applications.
