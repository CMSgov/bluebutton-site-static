In one of our early [blog posts](https://bluebutton.cms.gov/blog/Sample-Applications.html)
we provided links to a couple of sample client apps. We recognized that it is often
easier to take a sample application and modify it to meet the needs of a project,
rather than building something from scratch.

The Blue Button 2.0 Team has been busy as we prepare for our first
[Blue Button 2.0 Developer Conference](https://bluebutton.cms.gov/bb2dc18/) and team
members have created some more sample applications that our developer community can
build upon. We welcome open source contributions from other developers. If you want to
contribute a sample application you can share it with fellow developers via our
[Google Support Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/Developer-group-for-cms-blue-button-api).

Here are links to these latest sample client applications:

- Angular: <a href="https://github.com/CMSgov/bluebutton-sample-client-angular" target="_blank">bluebutton-sample-client-angular</a>
- Ruby on Rails: <a href="https://github.com/CMSgov/bluebutton-sample-client-rails" target="_blank">bluebutton-sample-client-rails</a>
- Spring: <a href="https://github.com/CMSgov/bluebutton-sample-client-spring-boot" target="_blank">bluebutton-sample-client-spring-boot</a>

In future blog posts we will cover how to install, configure, and run each of these
sample applications.
