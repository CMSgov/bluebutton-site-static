It is often easier to take a sample application and modify
it to meet the needs of a project, rather than building something from scratch.

The Blue Button 2.0 Team has created some sample applications that developers can be build upon. We will
continue to add to this library and welcome open source contributions from other developers.

Here are links to the current sample client applications:

- Node.js: <a href="https://github.com/CMSgov/bluebutton-sample-client-nodejs" target="_blank">bluebutton-sample-client-nodejs</a>
- Python/Django: <a href="https://github.com/CMSgov/bluebutton-sample-client-django" target="_blank">bluebutton-sample-client-django</a>

In future blog posts we will cover how to install, configure, and run each of these
sample applications.
