Developers, you asked if we could update Part D prescription claims more frequently than monthly. We heard you!

We are pleased to announce that Medicare Part D prescription data will now be updated weekly instead of monthly to match the update frequency of the Medicare Part A and B claims data. 

We look forward to our developer community taking advantage of this improvement to provide more timely information to Medicare beneficiaries as part of MyHealthEData. Through MyHealthEData, CMS will empower patients to be in control of their digital and personal health as well as make decisions as healthcare consumers.

As always, we welcome your feedback - just head over to the Google Group and leave us a message.
