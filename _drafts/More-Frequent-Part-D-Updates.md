# Blog: More frequent Prescription data updates
One of the changes that the Blue Button 2.0 API Team have been asked for is for more frequent updating of the Medicare Part D prescription data.

We are pleased to announce that the team have been able to change the update frequency for Prescription data from monthly to weekly. Part D data is now updated with the same frequency as Medicare Part A and B claims information.

We look forward to our developer community taking advantage of this improvement to provide more timely information to Medicare beneficiaries.

As always, we welcome your feedback - just head over to the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/Developer-group-for-cms-blue-button-api) and leave us feedback.
