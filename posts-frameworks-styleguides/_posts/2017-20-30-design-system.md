## Overview

The Design System is a set of open source design and front-end development resources for creating Section 508 compliant, responsive, and consistent websites. It builds on the U.S. Web Design Standards and extends it to support additional CSS and React components, utility classes, and a grid framework.

With the Design System, your team will be able to quickly prototype websites that are accessible, responsive, and production-ready.

#### Why should I use the design system?
- Create consistent, enjoyable, reliable, and Section 508 compliant websites
- Promote best practices for usability, accessibility, and responsive web design
- Empower teams and speed up the design and development process
- Have a single living source of truth for UI standards
- Quickly update your website when new findings to improve a userâ€™s experience emerge. You can contribute these findings back to the Design System to support other teams.
- Benefit from the findings and improvements of other teams as they contribute back to the Design System

#### Who can use the design system?
The Design System is open source and freely available to use by anyone.
