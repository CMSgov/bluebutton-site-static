Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) aims to enable third-party adoption of their products by open sourcing projects and sharing access to APIs, datasets, frameworks, and styleguides with anyone interested in building with these resources.

This effort aligns with U.S. Digital Services Playbook, which encourages government projects to default to open and to “enable reuse by entrepreneurs, nonprofits, other agencies, and the public.” The intended audiences for Developer.CMS.gov includes development teams working with CMS, industry partners, and the general public.

As more projects become available, they will be added to the home page. Check back for updates.
