## Overview

The Blue Button API contains four years of Medicare Part A, B and D data for 53 million Medicare beneficiaries.
This data reveals a variety of information about a beneficiary’s health, including type of Medicare coverage, drug prescriptions, primary care treatment and cost. Beneficiaries also have full control over how their data can be used and by whom, with identity and authorization controlled by MyMedicare.gov.

The Blue Button API uses the [HL7 FHIR standard](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) for beneficiary data and the [OAuth 2.0 standard](https://oauth.net/2/) for beneficiary authorization.

## Value and Use Cases

The Blue Button API adds new value for beneficiaries, providers, care organizations and health applications, and supports a number of use cases within the areas of Healthcare and Life Sciences.

#### You can use the Blue Button API to:

**_Reduce patient burden_**

- For example, a research organization can pre-populate medication lists for a patient during clinical trial enrollment

**_Streamline information about different kinds of care overtime_**

- For example, a primary care physician can access information on other patient care (e.g. related to behavioral health) to better inform treatment

**_Uncover new insights that can improve health outcomes_**

- For example, a pharmacy can determine if a beneficiary gets healthier over time due to medication adherence

**_Access and monitor health information in one place_**

- For example, a health application can aggregate data into a health dashboard for beneficiaries
