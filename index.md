## Overview

The Blue Button 2.0 API from CMS is an API that contains four years of Medicare Part A, B and D data for 53 million Medicare beneficiaries.

This data reveals a variety of information about a beneficiary’s health, including type of Medicare coverage, drug prescriptions, primary care treatment and cost. Beneficiaries also have full control over how their data can be used and by whom, with identity and authorization controlled by MyMedicare.gov.

The Blue Button 2.0 API uses the [HL7 FHIR standard](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) for beneficiary data and the [OAuth 2.0 standard](https://oauth.net/2/) for beneficiary authorization.
