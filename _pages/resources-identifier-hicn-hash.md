## Description
The Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) is a Medicare beneficiary's  identification number, used for paying claims and for determining  eligibility for services across multiple entities (e.g. Social Security  Administration (SSA), Railroad Retirement Board (RRB), States, Medicare  providers and health plans, etc.)

A HIC Number (HICN) is a Medicare beneficiary's identification number. Also remember when billing, ALWAYS use the name as it appears on the patient's Medicare Card.

Both CMS and the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) issue Medicare HIC numbers. The format of a HIC number issued by CMS is a Social Security number followed by an alpha or alphanumeric Beneficiary Identification Code (BIC).

RRB numbers issued before 1964 are six-digit numbers preceded by an alpha character.

After 1964, the RRB began using Social Security numbers as Medicare beneficiary identification numbers preceded by an alpha character.


**Below are the characteristics for each HIC Type**:

* 9 - Digit Social Security Number
* Alpha Suffix
    * "A" beneficiary (Retired Worker or disable worker)
    * "B" spouse (Spouse is over 65)
    * "C" children (child or grandchild of a retiree)
    * "D" divorced spouse, widow, widower
    * "E" widowed mother

Additional numerical digits provide more detailed relationship information (e.g., "C1" first child )
