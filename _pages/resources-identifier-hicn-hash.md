## Usage

**System URI**: `https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/identifier/hicn-hash`

## Description
Prior to the introduction of the Medicare beneficiary Identifier (MBI), the Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) acted as the Medicare beneficiary's  identification number and was used for paying claims and for determining  eligibility for services across multiple entities (e.g. Social Security  Administration (SSA), Railroad Retirement Board (RRB), States, Medicare  providers and health plans, etc.)

With a few exceptions, the HICN is no longer used. See `https://www.cms.gov/medicare/new-medicare-card` for more details.
