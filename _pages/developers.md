## Overview

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Blue Button API enables Medicare beneficiaries to connect their Medicare claims data to the applications, services, and research programs they trust.

The CMS Blue Button API:

- Enables a developer to register a beneficiary-facing application
- Enables a beneficiary to grant an application access to four years of their Part A, B, and D claims data
- Uses the [HL7 FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) standard for beneficiary data and the [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) standard for beneficiary authorization

---

## Authorization

To use the Blue Button OAuth 2 a developer must [register their application](https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v1/o/applications/).

A registered application is given a client ID and a client secret. The secret should only be used if it can be kept confidential, such as communication between your server and the Blue Button API. Otherwise the [Client Application Flow](#client-application-flow) may be used.

### Native Mobile App Support {#nativeMobileApp}

Native Mobile App Support follows the [RFC 8252 - OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252) authentication flow utilizing the [PKCE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636) extension and enables a custom URI scheme redirect.

The implementation of the [RFC 8252](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252) specification enables developers to build mobile applications without requiring a proxy server to route redirect calls to their mobile app.

The [PKCE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636) extension provides a technique for public clients to mitigate the threat of a “man-in-the-middle” attack. This involves creating a secret that is used when exchanging the authorization code to obtain an access token.

[PKCE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636) uses a code challenge that is derived from a code-verifier. The standard supports two styles of code challenge:
- plain
- S256

However, Blue Button 2.0 only supports the “S256” style code challenge.

Where the:  
``` python
codechallenge = BASE64URL-ENCODE(SHA256(ASCII(codeverifier)))
```

The following additional parameters and values are sent as part of the OAuth2.0 Authorization Request:
- `code_challenge`
- `codechallengemethod = “S256”`

More details can be found about this flow on [OAuth.com](https://www.oauth.com/). Check out this link: [Protecting Mobile Apps with PKCE - OAuth 2.0 Servers](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/pkce/)

### Registering Your App for Mobile App Support

When you register your application in the Blue Button 2.0 Developer Sandbox, you will want to specify a unique custom URI scheme. This should be a unique value that will not conflict with other custom URI schemes implemented on a user’s mobile device.

We recommend that you define your custom URI scheme using a reverse domain name notation. As we developed our own testing application, we implemented a custom URI scheme of:
- `gov.cms.bluebutton.oauthtester`

This equated to an `oauthtester` subdomain for the [bluebutton.cms.gov](bluebutton.cms.gov) domain.

The reverse DNS style custom URI scheme should then be coupled with the re-direct path on the mobile device that will handle the call back from the Blue Button 2.0 API.

For example:
``` python
tld.app.subdomain[.subsubdomain]:/callback/path/endpoint
```

A coding example of an OAuth 2.0 and PKCE flow is available here: [Authorization Code with PKCE Flow - OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://www.oauth.com/playground/authorization-code-with-pkce.html)

The Blue Button 2.0 engineering team has also created a sample Android application. You can review or fork the code here: [https://github.com/CMSgov/bluebutton-sample-client-android](https://github.com/CMSgov/bluebutton-sample-client-android)

### Redirect_URI

When creating an Application in the sandbox a redirect URI is required. This is the API endpoint on *your* system that receives the callback from the Blue Button 2.0 API after a beneficiary is passed to the Blue Button 2.0 API to authorize your application. 

Multiple redirect URIs can be entered in the Redirect_URI field. Each entry should be separated by a space or newline.

A `Redirect_URI` follows this format:
``` python
URLprotocol://[sub-domain.]domain_name[:port]/path
```

#### URL Protocol

Three URL protocols are supported, depending on the purpose:
- `http:// protocol`
- `https:// protocol`
- `custom_url:// protocol`

***`http:// protocol`***

(Works in: Sandbox only)

The `http://` format is only accepted in the sandbox environment. It is typically used by developers for local testing by using `http://localhost/` however, any domain name can be used.  

***`https://protocol`***

(Works in: Sandbox | Production)

The `https://` format is used for secure communication and is required for all applications in the production environment unless the application is using the Mobile OAuth method for handling callbacks.

***`custom_url:// protocol`***

(Works in: Sandbox | Production)

The `custom_url` protocol is used by mobile applications to handle communications directly with your application on a mobile device.

If you are using Mobile OAuth support for communication directly with a mobile device the `custom_url` should follow this format:
``` python
Top-level.domain(TLD).domain-name[.sub-domain][.app_name]
```

For example, if the Blue Button 2.0 team created an application we might create a custom_url of:
``` python
gov.cms.bluebutton.oauthtester
```
This would then be incorporated into a redirect URI entry. Here is an example:
``` python
gov.cms.bluebutton.oauthtester:8080//bluebutton_app/callback.html
```

### Web Application Flow

To use this flow your application should be registered with `Client Type` set to `confidential` and
`Grant Type` set to `authorization-code`.

#### Request authorization from user

To allow a user to authorize your application, direct them to Blue Button's `authorize` endpoint.
The request must include the `response_type` set to `code`, your application's client_id, and your application's redirect_uri. An optional `state` field that your application can use to identify the authorization request is recommended.

```
https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v1/o/authorize/?client_id=swBu7LWsCnIRfu530qnfPw1y5vMmER3lAM2L6rq2
    &redirect_uri=http://localhost:8080/testclient/callback
    &response_type=code
    &state=8e896a59f0744a8e93bf2f1f13230be5
```

#### Exchange `code` for `token`

After visiting the authorization page
a user will be redirected back to
the `redirect_uri`
registered with
your application.

For example if
the `redirect_uri`
is `http://localhost:8080/testclient/callback`
BlueButton will redirect with this request.

```
GET http://localhost:8080/testclient/callback?code=TSjqiZCdJwGyytGjz2GzziPfHTJ6z2
    &state=8e896a59f0744a8e93bf2f1f13230be5
```

Your application can now
exchange the code
provided in the redirected request
for a full `token`. Send a `POST`
request to the BlueButton `token`
endpoint providing the `code`,
the application's `client_id`,
`client_secret`,
and `redirect_uri`.
Your request
must also specify the `grant_type`
which should always be `authorization_code`
for this flow.

```
curl -X POST "https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v1/o/token/" \
    -u "swBu7LWsCnIRfu530qnfPw1y5vMmER3lAM2L6rq2:<client_secret>" \
    -d "code=TSjqiZCdJwGyytGjz2GzziPfHTJ6z2
	&grant_type=authorization_code
	&redirect_uri=http://localhost/testclient/callback"
```

Response
```
{
    "access_token": "oQlduHNr09GKCU506GOgp8OarrAy2q",
    "expires_in": 16768.523842,
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "scope": "profile patient/Patient.read patient/ExplanationOfBenefit.read patient/Coverage.read"
    "refresh_token": "wDimPGoA8vwXP51kie71vpsy9l17HN"
}
```

### Client Application Flow

To use this flow
your application should
be registered with
`Client Type` set to `public`
and
`Grant Type` set to `implicit`.

#### Request authorization from user

To use the client application flow
direct the user to
the Blue Button `authorization` endpoint
with the `response_type` parameter set to `token`.

```
https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v1/o/authorize/?client_id=swBu7LWsCnIRfu530qnfPw1y5vMmER3lAM2L6rq2
    &redirect_uri=http://localhost:8080/testclient/callback
    &response_type=token
    &state=8e896a59f0744a8e93bf2f1f13230be5
```

If the user authorizes your application
they will be redirected back to
the `redirect_uri` of your application.
The request will include an `access_token`
in the fragment.

```
http://localhost:8080/testclient/callback#access_token=KCHMTX5VHNAXYGYv38eG2RLAX4hL6R
    &expires_in=35849.875807
    &token_type=Bearer
    &scope=profile+patient%2FPatient.read+patient%2FExplanationOfBenefit.read+patient%2FCoverage.read
    &state=8e896a59f0744a8e93bf2f1f13230be5
```

Below you will find a sample account you can use to test your Blue Button OAuth implementation. This account mimics a valid MyMedicare.gov account but has reduced functionality. For example, you cannot test “Forgot Password” flow.

_Jane Doe Username: BBUser29999 Password: PW29999!_

## Core Resources

Base Request URL:

<pre>https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov</pre>

### FHIR Resources:

- Explanation of Benefit
- Patient
- Coverage

### UserInfo:
- Get User Profile from an Authorization Token

As a security measure the date of birth, SSN, and HICN will not be provided by the CMS Blue Button API.

We use [FHIR Extensions](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/extensibility.html#Extension) in our API responses.

**Explanation of Benefit FHIR Resource**

<pre>/v1/fhir/ExplanationOfBenefit/?patient=[fhir_id]</pre>

The above URL returns all of the beneficiary's Explanation of Benefit (sometimes referred to as an episode of care)
records as an [ExplanationOfBenefit FHIR Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/explanationofbenefit.html).
The bulk of a beneficiary's data is contained within these ExplanationOfBenefit FHIR resources.  
Each one can be thousands of lines long.

<pre>curl --header "Authorization: Bearer AUTHORIZATION TOKEN"  "https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v1/fhir/ExplanationOfBenefit/?patient=20140000008325"</pre>

That API call will return an Explanation of Benefit that contains many FHIR resources and is typically thousands of lines long.

**Compress Resources for more efficient data transfers**

To improve the performance when transferring large data resources it is possible to turn on compression. Gzip
compression is turned off by default. Compression can be activated for the following content types:

- text/html
- text/plain
- application/json
- application/json+fhir

To activate compression add the following to the header:

<pre>
Accept-Encoding: gzip
</pre>

The minimum payload size we will gzip is 1 kilobyte. If the original uncompressed size of the payload is less than 1 kb,
we will not apply gzip compression to our response. Therefore, developers should ensure their applications handle
this scenario gracefully by checking for the **Content-Encoding: gzip** response header before trying to
decompress.

**Get User Profile for an Authorization Token**

<pre>HTTP GET /connect/userinfo </pre>

The UserInfo Endpoint is an OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource.The above URL fetches the fictitious beneficiary’s basic account information given an Authorization Token. This is most often used when creating an account within your application. An HTTP GET is called and the response is returned as JSON.

<pre>curl --header "Authorization: Bearer AUTHORIZATION TOKEN" "https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v1/connect/userinfo"</pre>

## FHIR Data Model

We have mapped over 1,300 fields from the CMS claims data warehouse into FHIR.  These fields are surfaced across the Patient, Coverage and Explanation of Benefits FHIR resources.

- Beneficiary Enrollment Record
- Carrier Claims
- Durable Medical Equipment
- Home Health Agency Claims
- Hospice Claims
- Inpatient Claims
- Outpatient Claims
- Part D Events
- Skilled Nursing Facility Claims

The Blue Button API FHIR data model leverages coding systems specific to Medicare billing forms and/or the Chronic Conditions Warehouse, FHIR and Industry Coding Systems.

For Example:

- [National Drug Code Directory](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ndc/)
- [HL7 v3 Code System ActCode](http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActCode/cs.html)
- [ICD-10](http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/icd-10)

[View the full list of Blue Button API FHIR Data Model Coding Systems and Identifiers](https://github.com/CMSgov/bluebutton-data-server/blob/master/dev/data-model.md)

**How Often Will New/Updated Data Be Available?**

Medicare Part A and B claims data will be refreshed weekly, Part D data is refreshed monthly.

Our schedules may vary depending on many things like maintenance, delayed delivery of claims to the CCW data warehouse, or additional data quality processing that's needed.

We recommend you have a daily job to fetch new claims data for your users. Please be responsible with your API usage and comply with the Service Management Rights to Limit conditions in the Blue Button API Terms of Service.

**Synthetic Data**

The CMS Blue Button API offers a synthetic data set for developers to test against. This means that each request returns a realistic value. For example, if a patient is prescribed the diabetes medication Metformin, the associated cost and date of this prescription will be accurate.

Please note that this synthetic data set does not represent a longitudinal patient view. The claims—though representative independently—are shuffled and randomly assigned to patients. To build the synthetic data set, we selected a number of random claims, and shuffling them like a deck of cards among a group of fictitious Patient IDs. This will allow developers to test the Blue Button API system, but could result in a patient with records for contradictory procedures.

**Production Data**

The CMS Blue Button API has at least one claim for over 53M beneficiaries.

Today, there are approximately 38M beneficiaries in traditional or fee-for-service Medicare.  The Blue Button API has Part A/B/D data for those beneficiaries plus Part D data for some beneficiaries on Medicare Advantage plans.  

Part D has always been a separate program, but certain plans include both the MA benefits (Part C) and Part D.  As a result, Part D drug event data is collected separately from MA encounter data.  Part D drug event data for all participants in Part D has been collected by the agency since the program began in the mid-2000s.  

The API also has historical claims data going back four years.  All of these factors contribute to the 53M number we use to describe the total number of beneficiaries available via the Blue Button API.

## Try the API

To join the Developer Sandbox, register a sample application and retrieve synthetic data for a sample Patient ID by calling the API, follow these four steps:

**Step 1:** [Join the Developer Sandbox](https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v1/accounts/create) and register a sample application

Click "Application Registration" to register a new sample application and get a Client ID and Secret

**Step 2:** Generate a sample token

To test out the Blue Button API, you must first generate a sample token that represents a beneficiary granting consent.

You can generate an access token for synthetic Patient 20140000008325 and sample Application TestApp by following these steps:

1.  Login to the developer portal, click "Test Client" to begin and click "sample Authorization flow"
2.	Click the link to authorize. This will start the authorization flow to TestApp
3.	Login to your Blue Button Developer Sandbox Account (click [here](https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v1/accounts/create) if you need to Join the Developer Sandbox) and you will see a JSON document containing your access token and other information

You can now use your access token wherever "YOUR TOKEN HERE" is referenced below.

**Step 3:** Call the API

<pre>
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR TOKEN HERE" https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v1/fhir/Patient/20140000008325
</pre>

Or, try this out in Postman:

1. 	From Postman, open a new tab
2. 	Paste the Request URL: https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v1/fhir/Patient/20140000008325
3. 	Click "Authorization", select type "Bearer Token" and paste your token in the Token field
4. 	Click "Preview Request" and see a success message "Request headers were successfully updated with authorization data for preview."
5. 	Click "Send" and see the synthetic beneficiary's personal health information as a Patient FHIR Resource display under "Body" in Postman.

**Step 4:** View the API Response

In the API response for Patient 20140000008325 you will find:
- 32 total claims (140 total claim lines)
- 25 carrier claims (110 carrier claim lines)
- 2 inpatient claims (25 inpatient claim lines)
- 5 Part D events


**Step 5:** Accessing Synthetic Data
In order to access the full synthetic dataset, you can do the following:
1. Set up your sandbox application
2. Log out of [https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov](https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov).
3. Access the authorization url at [https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v1/o/authorize/](https://sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov/v1/o/authorize/)

    *Note: The last backslash is important*.
    *Also remember to append ?client_id={your client_id asigned to the application you registered}*

4. You will be redirected to the Medicare authentication screen on. DO NOT ACCESS THIS PAGE DIRECTLY.
5. Use one of thirty thousand provided usernames and passwords.

    The first user is BBUser00000, with password PW00000!, and these sample users continue all the way to BBUser29999, with password PW29999!.

    *Note: the ! at the end of the password is required*.

6. Approve access for your application, which will now receive an access token, which can be used in the requests described above.

7. The authorization completes when you are redirected back to the Redirect_URI you specified when you registered your application.

## Sample Beneficiaries

[CSV of 100 sample beneficiaries with rich claims data](/synthetic_users_by_claim_count_full.csv)

When getting started with the Blue Button API, it can be overwhelming to understand all of the coding systems and types of data that can be found in the Explanation of Benefit FHIR resource.

Below are some hypothetical Beneficiaries that gives you a sense of what is found in claims data.

**Meet Lucille**

Lucille is an 70-year old female. She has non-small cell lung cancer. Prior to her diagnosis, Lucille was active and had no significant health issues. She went on daily walks around her neighborhood, did yoga and made a concerted effort to eat healthy. Lucille smoked cigarettes for a few years when she was a teenager, but quit after her father passed away from lung cancer. Her only other family history is mild hypertension on her mother’s side.

Below are some examples you may find in the Explanation of Benefit FHIR resource for Lucille.

## Production API Access

Once you have successfully integrated with the CMS Blue Button API and are ready to go live, you can request access to the CMS Blue Button Production API by emailing bluebuttonapi@cms.hhs.gov.

**How long does it take to get my app approved?**

Typically this will take 1-2 weeks and involves a phone call and demo to the CMS Blue Button API team.

**What is the criteria I must meet to be considered for Production API access?**

First, you must register an application in the Blue Button Developer Sandbox and provide some basic information including:

- Your Name
- Email address
- Website
- Organization name
- Phone number

You also need to agree to the CMS Blue Button API Terms of Use when registering your app.

Next, the following criteria needs to be met and verified by the CMS Blue Button API team in a meeting with your organization:

- You are a US based company
- You have a working app or website that can be demoed to the CMS Blue Button API team
- Your app links to a Privacy statement or Terms of Use that explains to a beneficiary in plain language how you will use their data and how they can cancel their account
- Your app must serve a Medicare population except in certain general research scenarios
- You must articulate your business model and describe the value your app provides a beneficiary
- You must demonstrate how beneficiary data will be protected within your app

**What happens after I am approved?**

You will receive an email from the CMS Blue Button API team notifying you of approval.  You will then receive a new Client ID and Secret for your app in production.  You will use the base URL api.bluebutton.cms.gov instead of sandbox.bluebutton.cms.gov.

You will also agree to a future audit as part of a Production API access renewal process as your app versions update and the Blue Button API evolves.

## Developer Guidelines

Below are guidelines you should follow to be successful in your Blue Button API integration.

**Your Privacy Policy**

You will be asked to provide a URL to your privacy policy and terms and conditions when registering your app in the Blue Button Developer Portal.  These links should be easy to access and understand by a beneficiary using your app.  Consider using the [Model Privacy Notice](https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/model-privacy-notice-mpn).

**Rate Limiting and Data Refresh**

Medicare Part A and B claims data will be refreshed weekly, Part D data monthly.

Our schedules may vary depending on many things like maintenance, delayed delivery of claims to the CCW data warehouse, or additional data quality processing that's needed.

We recommend you have a daily or weekly job to fetch new claims data for your users.  Please be responsible with your API usage and comply with the Service Management Rights to Limit conditions in the [Blue Button API Terms of Service](/terms/).

**Use of the Blue Button Logo**

The Blue Button logo and usage guidelines is detailed [here](https://www.healthit.gov/patients-families/blue-button/blue-button-image).

**Beneficiary Revokes Access**

A beneficiary may revoke access to your application via the MyMedicare.gov website.  When you encounter an invalid token indicating a beneficiary has revoked access, you should make a reasonable attempt to handle that case making it easy for the beneficiary to understand what is happening with their Medicare data.
