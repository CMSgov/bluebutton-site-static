    <name value="Dispense as Written (DAW) Product Selection Code"/>
    <description value="This field indicates the prescriber's instruction regarding substitution of generic equivalents or order to dispense the specific prescribed medication. Part D plans generally require pharmacies to use generics or the least expensive version of the prescribed drug. However, there are times when a prescriber intends for the beneficiary to receive the drug exactly as it is written on the prescription (e.g., to get the brand-name version of a drug). When there are specific instructions from the prescriber, it is indicated in this variable with a value of 1 or greater. Source: https://bluebutton.cms.gov/resources/variables/daw_prod_slctn_cd"/>
