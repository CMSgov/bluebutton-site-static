    <description value="The present on admission (POA) indicator code associated with the diagnosis codes (principal and secondary). In response to the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, CMS began to distinguish between hospitalization diagnoses that occurred prior to versus during the admission. The objective was to eventually not pay hospitals more if the patient acquired a condition (e.g., infection) during the admission. This present on admission (POA) field is used to indicate whether the diagnosis was present on admission. Medicare claims did not indicate whether a diagnosis was POA until 2011.
