This is a folder for files that are linked to blog posts or other pages. They should not be deleted or removed without proper investigation because they are used by other blog posts. For example, the `Prod-Sandbox-SyntheticData-LastUpdated.csv` file is referenced in the blog post "Get Just the Claims Data You Need" - removing this file would result in a broken link.

Proceed with caution when removing or changing these files.
