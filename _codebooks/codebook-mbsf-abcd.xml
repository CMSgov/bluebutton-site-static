            <p>The unique CCW identifier for a beneficiary. The CCW assigns a unique beneficiary identification number to each individual who receives Medicare and/ or Medicaid, and uses that number to identify an individual’s records in all CCW data files (e.g., Medicare claims, MAX claims, MDS assessment data). This number does not change during a beneficiary’s lifetime and each number is used only once. The BENE_ID is specific to the CCW and is not applicable to any other identification system or data source.</p>

            <p>This variable counts the total number of months during the year when the beneficiary premium was paid by the state. State Medicaid programs can pay Medicare premiums for certain dual eligibles (i.e., for beneficiaries also enrolled in a state Medicaid program); this action is called “buying in” and so this variable is the “buy-in code.” Any month where the BUYINXX variable was: A (Part A state buy-in), B (Part B state buy-in), or C (Part A and Part B state buy-in) is counted.</p>

            <p>This variable indicates whether the beneficiary was entitled to Part A, Part B, or both for a given month. There are 12 monthly variables - where the 01 through 12 at the end of the variable name correspond with the month (e.g., 01 is January and 12 is December).</p>
            <p>The variable also indicates whether the beneficiary’s state of residence paid his/her monthly premium for Part B coverage (and Part A if necessary). State Medicaid programs can pay those premiums for certain dual eligibles; this action is called “buying in” and so this variable is the “buy-in code.”</p>

            <p>Each state has a series of codes beginning with '000' for each county within that state.</p>
            <p>Certain cities within that state have their own code. County codes must be combined with state codes in order to locate the specific county. The coding system is the SSA system, not the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). In some cases, the code may not be the actual county where the beneficiary resides. CMS obtains the mailing address used for cash benefits or the mailing address used for other purposes (for example, premium billing) from Social Security Administration (SSA) and Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) Beneficiary Record Systems.</p>

            <p>This variable indicates how the beneficiary currently qualifies for Medicare. The current reason for entitlement can differ from the original reason that a beneficiary qualified for Medicare (see the OREC variable).

            <p>The current beneficiary identification code (BIC) specifies the basis of the beneficiary’s eligibility for cash payment programs, mainly Social Security. When the individual qualifies under another person’s account (for example, as a spouse or child), the code identifies the type of relationship between the individual and primary beneficiary.</p>

            <p>This variable indicates the beneficiary’s Part D low-income subsidy cost sharing group for a given month (January). The Part D benefit requires enrollees to pay both premiums and cost-sharing, but the program also has a low-income subsidy (LIS) that covers some or all of those costs for certain low-income individuals, including deductibles and cost-sharing during the coverage gap.</p>

            <p>This variable indicates the beneficiary’s Part D low-income subsidy cost sharing group for a given month (June). The Part D benefit requires enrollees to pay both premiums and cost-sharing, but the program also has a low-income subsidy (LIS) that covers some or all of those costs for certain low-income individuals, including deductibles and cost-sharing during the coverage gap.</p>

            <p>The original source for this variable is the State Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) files that states submit to CMS. Those files are considered the “gold standard” for identifying dual eligibles because the information in them is used to determine the level of Medicare Part D low-income subsidies. Dual eligibles are often divided into “full duals” and “partial duals” based on the level of Medicaid benefits they receive. CMS generally considers beneficiaries to be full duals if they have values of 02, 04, or 08, and to be partial duals if they have values of 01, 03, 05, or 06. Partial duals sometimes divided into the QMB-only population (01) and all other partial duals (03, 05, or 06). There are different ways to classify dually eligible beneficiaries. Additional information regarding various ways to identify dually enrolled populations, refer to a CCW Technical Guidance document entitled: "Options in Determining Dual Eligibles". There are 12 monthly variables - where the 01 through 12 at the end of the variable name correspond with the month (e.g., 01 is January and 12 is December).</p>

Partial duals sometimes divided into the QMB-only population (01) and all other partial duals (03, 05, or 06). There are different ways to classify dually eligible beneficiaries. Additional information regarding various ways to identify dually enrolled populations, refer to a CCW Technical Guidance document entitled: "Options in Determining Dual Eligibles". There are 12 monthly variables - where the 01 through 12 at the end of the variable name correspond with the month (e.g., 01 is January and 12 is December).</p>

            <p>This enhanced 5% sample is broader than the annual 5% sample (variable that was previously called FIVE_PERCENT_FLAG; currently called SAMPLE_GROUP - when value ='01' or '04') because it includes all beneficiaries who were ever part of the 5% sample but had a HIC change that was not part of the sample. The "enhanced" indicator variable allows for longitudinal study of the 5% sample (i.e., once in, always in).</p>
            <p>CCW creates the 5% sample using standard CMS processes. The 5% random sample consists of people who had a Medicare beneficiary Health Insurance Claim number (HIC) equal to the Claim Account Number (CAN) plus Beneficiary Identity Code (BIC) (HIC=CAN+BIC) where the last two digits of the CAN are in the set {05, 20, 45, 70, 95}.</p>

            <p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has updated the Medicare enrollment source data for the Master Beneficiary Summary File (MBSF). As of March 2017, the MBSF includes Medicare enrollment information from the CMS Common Medicare Environment (CME) rather than the CMS Common Medicare Environment (CME). Data from the two sources was nearly identical. The CME improves the identification of Medicare Part B enrollment and also allows for more timely release of the MBSF.</p>
            <p>The universe of beneficiaries in the CME versus the EDB version of the MBSF are only slightly different.</p>

            <p>This variable is created by taking the beneficiary race code that has historically been used by the Social Security Administration (and is in turn used in CMS’s enrollment data base) and applying an algorithm that identifies more beneficiaries as Hispanic or Asian.</p>
            <p>This algorithm was developed by the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) and is thus often referred to as the “RTI race code”.</p>
            <p>The algorithm classifies beneficiaries as Hispanic or Asian if their SSA race code equals 4 (Asian) or 5 (Hispanic), or if they have a first or last name that RTI determined was likely Hispanic or Asian in origin.</p>

        <comment>
            <p>CCW creates the sample values using standard CMS processes to identify the random 1, 5, 15, and 20 percent samples of Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
            <p>The sample groups are based on a random 20 percent sample that is split into three mutually exclusive groups of 1 percent, 4 percent, and 15 percent.</p>
            <p>To use the 1 percent sample, specify that SAMPLE_GRP equals “01”.</p>
            <p>To use the 5 percent sample, specify that SAMPLE_GRP equals “01” or “04”.</p>
            <p>To use the 15 percent sample, specify that SAMPLE_GRP equals “15”.</p>
            <p>To use the 20 percent sample, specify that SAMPLE_GRP equals “01”, “04”, or “15”.</p>
            <p>Beneficiaries are assigned to sample groups each year based on the last two digits of their Medicare Claim Account Numbers (CANs). Since CANs can change over time (e.g., in the case of remarriage), new beneficiaries are becoming eligible for Medicare, and existing beneficiaries are dying, the sample is cross-sectional. There is no guarantee that the exact same beneficiaries are represented in the same sample group from one year to the next (i.e., this is the strict sampling).</p>

            <p>If the beneficiary did not have a Part D plan for a given month, this variable will have null/missing value for that month. If the beneficiary changed plans during the year, the value indicates market segment identifier for the final, reconciled PBP. For 2006 - 2012, this variable was always encrypted to comply with CMS privacy rules.</p>
            <p>There are 12 monthly variables - where the 01 through 12 at the end of the variable name correspond with the month (e.g., 01 is January and 12 is December).</p>
            <p>You need to know the Part D contract number (PTD_CNTRCT_ID_XX) and plan benefit package (PTD_PBP_ID_XX) in order to determine the geographic market areas where the particular PBP was offered. Premiums may vary by market segment.</p>
